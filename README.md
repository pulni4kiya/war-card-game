# War Card Game
Known issues:
- Some asset bundles are not properly loaded / unloaded (for optimal memory usage)
- Asset bundles are handled manually instead of using the Addressable Assets system
- Code could be better organized (works, but is not particularly pretty / modular)
- Not exactly an issue, but project uses git-lfs and some images would not download through GitHub's download button. That shouldn't prevent testing it this way as they are loaded from a server in-game anyway.
